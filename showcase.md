 These are projects that I completed during this time to explore new tools and technologies. I've found that often 
 the best way to understand the pros and cons of a given tool, language, or framework is to just build something and 
 see what the experience is like. Therefore, I completed a few projects to explore some new tools and technologies. 
 I frequently explored multiple on the same project.

 ### Layer of the Ancients

 #### Summary

 - directory: [/courses/character_manager](/courses/character_manager)
 - technologies explored:
   -  GraphQL
   -  Typescript
   -  MongoDB
   -  MaterialUI

#### What it does

 Essentially LotA is a D&D character tracker. The general vision was Github for D&D characters. You could create, 
 edit, and delete your own characters. You could also explore other people's characters, fork them, and modify them 
 for your self. It has a full auth system, searching, light / dark modes, file handling and uploading, 
 and entity ownership and transfer.

 #### After Thoughts
 
 This is probably the largest project I worked on. It also has the most new technologies explored. Truth be told, 
 I probably will not build another project this large for 100 days of code because it took about 55% of my time, 
 which was time I could have spent exploring these things individually and gaining a better understanding of each. 
 Still, I learned quite a bit, and the project itself now serves as an example of doing many things. Material UI is
 now standard for my projects. I am typically not a fan of GraphQL after the project because auth gets *very* **very** 
 complex. It's great for the frontend, but adds quite a bit of effort on the backend. I am now a major advocate for
 Mongo in specific situations where data structure is not incredibly consistent. I found Typescript solves many 
 problems that I typically don't have. I largely maintain that it is something that helps a lot with large projects,
 but smaller ones are probably less benefited by it.

 These are all pure HTML & CSS chanlenges where I use a picture from [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/) of a UI 
 challenge and try to replicate it as closely as possible in HTML and CSS. Any lack of fidelity to the original
 or any oddities are largely explained by the fact that I kept to a strict hour for these. That was part of the 
 challenge. So the goal:

 **Replicate the original image as closely as possible in HTML and CSS in an hour or less**
